# ðŸš€ Blockchain Journey â€“ Becoming a Smart Contract Engineer

Welcome to my Web3 Journey repository!  
I am a software engineer with 10+ years of experience (Java, Spring Boot, payment systems) and Iâ€™m transitioning into blockchain development and smart contracts.

This repository serves as a learning hub and portfolio index, documenting my progress, projects, and articles as I build expertise in Solidity, Web3, and decentralized applications (DApps).
